# AI-Powered Calculator App

## Objective
Build a multi-platform AI-powered calculator that solves equations, graphs problems, and interprets hand-drawn inputs with a user-friendly interface.

## Approach
- **Interactive Canvas:** React-based drawing with color selection, reset, and draggable LaTeX outputs.  
- **Math Rendering:** MathJax for LaTeX expression display.  
- **Backend Integration:** FastAPI handles image inputs, solves equations, and returns results.  
- **API Usage:** Gemini flash API integrated via secure environment variables.  
- **State Management:** React hooks manage drawing, colors, LaTeX, and backend responses.

## Result
- Accurately interprets hand-drawn equations and displays results dynamically.  
- Supports complex math functions with real-time responses.  
- User-friendly interface with color swatches, reset, and draggable results.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Draggable  
- **Backend:** FastAPI, Python  
- **Libraries:** MathJax, Axios  
- **Tools:** Google AI Studio for API keys, Environment variables for security
